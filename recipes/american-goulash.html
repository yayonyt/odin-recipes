        <h2 class="subheading">Description</h2>

        <p class="content">American goulash was one of my all-time favorite comfort food meals when I was growing up. They served it in my school cafeteria alongside a slice of buttered white bread and a carton of milk. This Americanized version of goulash was invented to stretch a small amount of beef into enough food for a not-so-small family. It's a simple dish that doesn't taste simple, so it's perfect for your weeknight dinner rotation.</p>

        <h2 class="subheading">Ingredients</h2>

        <ul class="content">

            <li>1 quart chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 cups elbow macaroni</li>

        </ul>

        <h2 class="subheading">Steps</h2>

        <ol class="content">

            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Add ground beef and onion; cook and stir until beef is browned and crumbly and onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Continue to cook and stir until liquid is evaporated, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic, bay leaves, paprika, Italian seasoning, salt, black pepper, and cayenne.</li>
            <li>Cook, stirring occasionally, until flavors come together, about 3 minutes. Pour in broth, marinara sauce, and diced tomatoes. Pour water into the sauce jar, swirl, and pour into the pot. Stir in soy sauce; bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until flavors intensify, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a rapid simmer. Stir in macaroni; cook, stirring occasionally, until just barely tender, about 12 minutes. Check for doneness after 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat and discard bay leaves. Stir in Cheddar and parsley. Cover and let rest for 5 minutes. Taste and season as desired.</li>
            <li><strong>Tip:</strong>Make your own Italian herb mix with a blend of oregano, thyme, rosemary, sage, parsley, and basil. Feel free to use water instead of chicken broth. You can also add beans to turn this into an excellent pasta fazool.</li>

        </ol>
